This project is only designed to instrument android applications.

The general structure is:
--edu.gatech.appInst
 --- Main, 			the entry point of the program. It will initialize all the command line arguments 
 					for Soot. And will decide about which class to instrument.
 --- Instrumentor, 	the key part for instrumenting. It will go through each classes and methods.
 --- AddUninstrClassesToJar, after instrumenting, put all the instrumented and un-instrumented class file
					into a jar file.
 --- DummyMain, 	seems useless, just used to support Soot.
 --- G, 			contains all the global functions, especially to help add a new method when instrumenting.
 --- Printer,		helper class to output the class files before and after instrumenting.
 
--edu.gatech.util
 --- innerClass,	all the implementations for methods to be added into class files.
