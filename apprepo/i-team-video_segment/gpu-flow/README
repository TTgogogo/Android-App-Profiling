NOTE THAT THE INCLUDED BINARIES WILL ONLY WORK ON 64bit LINUX OR 32bit WINDOWS XP! 
(The Linux binaries were built with Ubuntu Jaunty.)

Prerequisites:
 All applications and libraries of this provided package requires a CUDA enabled NVidia
 graphics device. You need to have at least Cuda 2.2 installed to use the included library.
 For convenience i suggest to use cmake with FindCUDA from 
 https://gforge.sci.utah.edu/gf/project/findcuda/.

Optical Flow Library: 
 The binary library can be found in the lib directories. See the header file FlowLib.h
 for documentation of the functionality and the doc directory for the Doxygen documentation. 
 For easier usage you can download <cudatemplates> from http://cudatemplates.sf.net.

Description:
 The Optical Flow Library provides the user with a fast optical flow calculation between
 two images. The algorithm uses Total Variation regularization, and a gray value
 constancy assumption. The optical flow is dense, and provides sharp edges. In addition
 the total variation regularization term is replaced by the so-called Huber function
 with its origin in the field of robust statistics to remove the well-known stair-casing
 artefacts of the total variation regularization. In addition a diffusion-tensor is used
 as weighting function for the regularization term. This enhances the flow accuracy near
 edges and corners due to the additional information of edge direction in the energy
 minimization step.

 To increase the robustness of optical flow calculations on difficult data, three frames
 are taken into account using a second data fidelity term. The resulting energy
 optimization problem can be solved with few extra costs in performance. Especially if
 single frames contain erroneous data the three-frame method gains robustness
 calculating the flow field.


Example - Demo:
 A simple commandline application is provided to test the library and show its basic
 usage. To compile the application you need cudatemplates and boost as dependencies. The
 CMakeLists file uses the FindCuda and FindBoost modules to search for its include
 directories. You can download the FindCuda module from:
 http://www.sci.utah.edu/~abe/FindCuda.html Again the <cudatemplates> can be found at
 the previously given SF website.
 
 As a result for optical flow fields a .flo file can be generated. This format is taken
 from the Middlebury Optical Flow evaluation database and can be converted into colored
 flow image with the help of Matlab or c++. A binary for conversion is included in the
 cmd/bin directory for Linux. For Windows you can use the matlab files in the 
 cmd/flow-code-matlab directory.
 
 The Windows example was built using Visual Studio 2009 whereas the Linux binary was built 
 with gcc 4.3.
