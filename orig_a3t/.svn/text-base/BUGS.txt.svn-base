1. Put comment with each svn commit, and commit one logical thing at a time, so that it is easy to revert.

2. Put lots of delay between and after Tap events in monkey script:

  count = 2
  speed = 1000
  start data >>
  DispatchKey(0,0,0,82,0,0,0,0)
  UserWait(4000)
  Tap(136.0,351.0)
  UserWait(4000)

  It appears that increasing the delay can never hurt (but we might be wrong).

3. Android SDK has native methods and object recycling (e.g., of MotionEvent objects).  Since we do not
   instrument entire SDK but instead introduce symbolic input variables at special functions designated
   by us (e.g., deliverPointerEvent), we must be careful to capture the effect of parts of the SDK that
   are bypassed by our instrumentation.  For instance, symbolic variables attached to recyled objects
   must be reset.

4. Do not output too much stuff to the log (via Slog or Log).  The buffer size is limited and it will
   get truncated.  Increase size of log (default = 16 KB) in logcat.cpp in SDK.

5. PROBLEM: Seeing the following lines in logcat:

	TODO

   SOLUTION: Ensure that you are using the instrumented system.img:

   emulator -avd <avd name> -system ./instr_image/system.img  

6. PROBLEM: Seeing the following output. That is it finishes after 1 run, even if the max iter is set 
   to more.

     [java] ============= Run 0 ===============
     [java] Seed run = 0
     [java] Hijack index = 0
     [java] the process has already died...did it crash?
     [java] branch cov. = 0 (0 new)
     [java] change in dang. branches = 0 (0 total)
     [java] traceLength 0 depth 0
     [java] =====================================
     [java] Total number of runs = 1
 
  SOLUTION: Ensure that you have installed the app.

7. PROBLEM: Seeing the following when installing an app
    -dex:
     [echo] Converting compiled files and external libraries into /export/pag/users/saswat/apps/RandomMusicPlayer/bin/classes.dex...
    [apply] unknown option: --output
    [apply] usage:
    [apply]   dx --dex [--debug] [--verbose] [--positions=<style>] [--no-locals]
  
  SOLUTION: change <sdk-dir>/tools/ant/main_rules.xml to  
          <arg value="--output=${intermediate.dex.file}" />   

8. PROBLEM: Seeing the following when running emulator on instrumented code:

   Cannot open file /sdcard/pkg.txt (Permission Denied)

   SOLUTION: Happens if you click on (0, y) where y < 39 (e.g., y == 38.9).
   Fix it by adding a constraint y >= 39
